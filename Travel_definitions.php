    <h4>What is Tourism?</h4>
        <p>
            Tourism is generally regarded as traveling to a different location for business or pleasure purposes. However, it has quite a specific definition: traveling to another environment for at least 24 hours, but for no longer than one year, for purposes related to business or leisure.<br>
            A tourist is generally only classed as such if they stay in overnight accommodation situated in the location they travel to. By its very nature, tourism involves a round trip rather than travel in one direction only. With this in mind, the tourism industry refers to all aspects of the service industry that cater to tourists.
        </p>

        <h4>What is Travel?</h4>
        <p>
            Travel refers to the act of moving from one location to another. This can refer to long-distance, short-distance, overseas, domestic, and various other forms. Crucially, travel also includes both round trips and one-way journeys, and it covers a wide variety of different travel purposes.<br>
            The travel industry, therefore, refers to the numerous aspects of the wider service industry which cater to the needs and desires of those who have traveled from one part of the world to another.
        </p>

        <h6>Difference between Travel and Tourism</h6>
        <p>
            Given the definitions above, it is understandable that many people struggle to see much of a distinction between the tourism industry and the travel industry. Indeed, there is clearly a significant overlap between the two, and many of the businesses and services that cater to tourists also cater to travelers more generally.<br>
            Nevertheless, there are some notable differences. Essentially, the tourism industry is concerned with people traveling for business or pleasure purposes, staying at their destination for at least one night, and returning. By contrast, the travel industry has a wider scope, covering more travel purposes and durations.
        </p>

        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <p>
            The transportation sector is one of the most obvious sectors that falls under both the travel and tourism umbrellas and is concerned with the movement of people from one location to another. This includes various types of travel, including air, road, rail, and water-based methods. This sector enables tourism in the first place, but also provides tourists with a means of getting around after they arrive at their destination.<br>
            <strong>Airline Industry</strong><br>
            Air travel is one of the main ways that tourists and travelers reach their chosen destinations, and the airline industry provides various services, including scheduled and chartered flights. Companies within this sub-category may offer flights to domestic and international destinations and long-haul and short-haul flights.<br>
            <strong>Car Rental</strong><br>
            Car rental services provide customers with temporary access to a car. These services can enable tourists or travelers to actually get to their chosen destination in the first place. Still, many customers use them after arriving, as they provide more freedom for exploration than relying on public transport.<br>
            <strong>Water Transport</strong><br>
            As the name suggests, the water transport sub-category includes all forms of transport that carry passengers across the water. This includes ocean liners and ferries, which tend to voyage from point A to point B, and cruise ships, where transportation is not the only purpose, and the voyage itself is a huge part of the travel experience.<br>
            <strong>Coach Services</strong><br>
            In many cases, coach services are one of the most cost-effective ways for tourists or travelers to reach their chosen destinations, and they are especially popular for day trips. However, coach travel does cater for international travel too. Moreover, local bus services also fall under this umbrella.<br>
            <strong>Railway</strong><br>
            Railways are another popular transportation method, helping passengers to get from one location to another easily. Rail services are especially popular with domestic travelers, due to their convenience and regularity. Moreover, many major cities use subway-style rail services, facilitating quick and easy movement.
        </p>


        <h4>Accommodation</h4>
        <p>
            The travel and tourism industries also contain the accommodation sector, with people requiring overnight accommodation for varying lengths of time. The accommodation industry offers various options for customers, catering to different tastes, budgets, and requirements. In addition to providing shelter and a place to sleep, many companies in the accommodation sector also provide various other services.<br>
            <strong>Hotels</strong><br>
            The most popular form of accommodation for tourists, hotels are establishments that offer overnight stays on a short-term basis. They provide guests private rooms, typically including an en suite bathroom and other facilities. Most hotels also provide housekeeping, room service, and laundry.<br>
            <strong>Shared Accommodation</strong><br>
            The rise of platforms like Airbnb has increased the popularity of shared accommodation, which typically consists of a space in a house that may be shared with the owners. The accommodation itself may consist of a private room, or maybe a room shared with other guests using the facility simultaneously.<br>
            <strong>Hostels</strong><br>
            Hostels are a form of shared-room lodging where guests pay for a bed in a dormitory-style setup. Rooms will each provide multiple beds, with guests sharing kitchen and bathroom facilities. They are typically classed as a budget option and are usually provided on a self-catering basis.<br>
            <strong>Camping</strong><br>
            A form of outdoor accommodation that uses temporary shelter, usually in a tent. Tourists and camp travelers may opt to stay at a commercial campsite, providing additional facilities or amenities. Alternatively, they might prefer to make their own campsite in a publicly accessible area, like a national park.<br>
            <strong>Bed and Breakfast</strong><br>
            Most bed and breakfast accommodation is situated in a converted private house or pub, and will provide guests with a private room for the night and breakfast in the morning. In many cases, the owner of the B&B will live in the building too. Guests may be offered en suite bathroom facilities, or they may need to share them.<br>
            <strong>Cruises</strong><br>
            Cruises are classed as both a form of transportation and accommodation. This is because those on the cruise are allocated their cabin, where they can rest, relax and sleep. Passengers spend most of the cruise on the cruise ship, benefiting from classic accommodation services.<br>
            <strong>Farmhouse Accommodation and Agri-Tourism</strong><br>
            Agri-tourism remains a fairly niche concept, but one which is gaining increased traction, with tourists spending time on a farm, seeing the day-to-day work that goes on first-hand, and even joining in. Farmhouse accommodation is simply accommodation that facilitates this kind of experience, and it often resembles a B&B.
        </p>

        <h4>Entertainment</h4>
        <p>
            Once tourists or travelers arrive at their chosen destination, they will often need entertainment, even if that is not the primary purpose of their journey. However, in many cases, companies or establishments providing entertainment are one of the major attractions drawing people to a location in the first place. Some of the sub-categories within the entertainment sector of the travel and tourism industry are outlined below.<br>
            <strong>Casino</strong><br>
            A casino is an entertainment establishment that provides people with opportunities to gamble – primarily through luck-based cards, dice, and slot games. In addition to these games, many casinos are connected to hotels or resorts, and many also host other entertainment, such as musical or comedy performances.<br>
            <strong>Tourist Information</strong><br>
            The tourist information sub-category is focused on providing travelers with important information about things to do in the local area. This includes offline methods, such as tourist information offices and leaflets, and online methods, such as informational websites and social media accounts.<br>
            <strong>Shopping</strong><br>
            Shops play a varied role in the travel and tourism industries, catering to people’s basic needs, while also providing a form of entertainment. Indeed, many people travel to specific parts of the world to experience shopping in that location, including 5th Avenue in New York, Bond Street in London, and Rodeo Drive in LA.<br>
            <strong>Tourist Guides & Tours</strong><br>
            Tourist guides offer organized tours of a location, typically taking a group of people to some of the important attractions or tourist sites nearby. The tourist guide’s role is factual information and context, helping to make the tour more interesting and educational.
        </p>

            <strong>EP or European Plan</strong><br>
